# Python - Hello, World

This repository contains introductory exercises to the Python programming language, specifically aimed at understanding how to work with strings, print values, and use the Python interpreter.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain, without the help of Google:

### General
- How to use the Python interpreter
- How to print text and variables using the `print` function
- How to handle strings
- What indexing and slicing in Python are
- What the official Python coding style is and how to check your code with pycodestyle

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.*)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the repository, containing a description of the repository is required
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Tasks
